Designed and coded mostly by SaucyK.

Drug Compound is built on top of the following libraries:

Gosu Lib: http://libgosu.org/
Chingu: https://github.com/erisdiscord/gosu-ring


Special thanks to:

Erisdiscord for the gosu-ring menu. I couldn't get it to work so I built my own but I heavily drew on gosu-ring for development, especially the ContextMenuArray class.


Thanks to everyone else that has contributed either directly or indirectly!
